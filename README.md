## How I Created My Portfolio

I created my portfolio during my UX/UI Design class. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase all my work I have created throughout my time in the IMD program at Algonquin College. The inspiration behind my design stems off of a few key factors. First, I wanted to keep it one page. I wanted to have a simple and modern feel to it. So, I ordered my content in a user-friendly way which makes all the content easy to consume. Then, I wanted to cater to my childhood so, I went with a blue felt background. The felt reminds me of my childhood because I grew up around pool tables and poker tables. The simplicity (i.e. no specialization on my portfolio) is also attributed to my portfolio more being a showcase of my work than trying to get business. I do not know which part of media design I enjoy most yet, so it's easier to stay neutral. Also, staying neutral shows I'm open to any business opportunities displayed on my portfolio. 

## Challenges I Faced Creating My Portfolio

I had issues deciding how many detail I wanted to add to it. As I mentioned, I wanted it to be simple and user-friendly so adding a lot of features and content is something I wanted to try to stay away from in some regards. Additionally, I had issues with the Navigation. I still don't know if I am happy with how it is. I think I would like the nav to follow the user as they scroll through the page, but I think that would hinder the experience and I don't think the Nav is bad how it currently is. 

Most issues were resolved through troubleshooting. If the spacing wasn't ideal, I would just do a trial and error readjustment for example. Other issues (in terms of design) were resolved through determining the true needs/intended experience of the user and then catering the coding to fulfill those needs.
